# mongodb-unique-ids

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/suprememoocow/mongodb-unique-ids.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/suprememoocow/mongodb-unique-ids)

A tiny utility for returning a unique set of `ObjectID`-like identifiers, given
an array of `ObjectID`-like identifiers.

```shell
npm install mongodb-unique-ids
```

## Why not just use `_.unique`?

1. `_.unique` is `O(nÂ²)`. If you have large arrays of ids, it will severely impact on your server performance.
2. `_.unique` doesn't even work with ObjectIDs.

## Using

```javascript
var uniqueIds = require('mongodb-unique-ids');
uniqueIds(['51adcd412aefe1576f000005', '51adcd412aefe1576f000006']) // -> ['51adcd412aefe1576f000005', '51adcd412aefe1576f000006']
uniqueIds(['51adcd412aefe1576f000005', '51adcd412aefe1576f000005']) // -> ['51adcd412aefe1576f000005']
uniqueIds([new ObjectID('51adcd412aefe1576f000005'), new ObjectID('51adcd412aefe1576f000005')]) // -> [new ObjectID('51adcd412aefe1576f000005')]
```
